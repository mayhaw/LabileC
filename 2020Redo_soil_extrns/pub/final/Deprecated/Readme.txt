These were all done with an erroneous random term of simply (1|block) in an lmer model, so the error term for the treatments was all wrong since r looks for the term with a random term and that variable as the error term, ie for clt or nut it woul dbe block/clt:nut, otherwise its jus tresidual (which is huge, like 55df) and block is just its own random thing. ANyways it is a huge type 1 error generator (falsely rejecting the null) for these main plot terms since they are compared against a ll this variability and over so many more experimental units rather tahn just the main plot within block variability.
